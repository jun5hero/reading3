      <h2>-Summary-
      </h2>
          <h3>What is a Website?</h3>

          <p>A website is a file or bundle of files living on a server somewhere.
          A server is a computer that’s always connected to the internet, so that when someone types your URL in, the server will offer up your website.
          In this age of digital cacophony dominated by these platforms, no one is looking out for you… but you.
          Clarity is one of many possible intentions for a website.
          A website has the characteristic of duality: it could be both subject and object at the same time.
          Website helps form your identity.</p>


          <h3>Why have a website?</h3>

          <p>The web is called the web because its vitality depends on just that—an interconnected web of individual nodes breathing life into a vast network.
          Websites are living, temporal spaces. What happens to websites after death, anyway?</p>


          <h3>What can a website be?</h3>

          <p>A room :
          finite space with a specific intended purpose,
          Flexible when moving contents

          A shelf:
          Not too heavy and replaceable.
          Could be knowledge-containing or not

          A plant:
          Grow on their own,
          It could bloom flowers or fruits if with luck

          A garden:
          Growing ideas in the garden,
          Have own ways in each season

          A puddle:
          A temporary collection,
          No state of completeness,
          Ephemeral by nature,
          Evaporate slowly over time

          A thrown rock that’s now falling deep into the ocean:
          Plentiful and could be done repeatedly,
          Don’t know the end,
          Want to leave it without maintaining it.</p>


          <h3>The web is what we make it</h3>

          <p>“World Wide Web,” only about half the world is connected, so we should close this digital divide.
          “I want to challenge us all to have greater ambitions for the web. I want the web to reflect our hopes and fulfill our dreams, rather than magnify our fears and deepen our divisions.”-Berners Lee
          If a website has endless possibilities, and our identities, ideas, and dreams are created and expanded by them, then it’s instrumental that websites progress along with us.</p>



          <br/><br/>

        <h2>-My Personal thought-</h2>

        <p>The websites that we use these days are mostly search engines like Google or Social Network Services like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and Instagram. We usually don't have a website of our own or we just consider it as a space to keep records or show personal works.

        <br/><br/>
        Considering how big the space is and how flexible it is, we could do anything. We could code a virtual self on the web that could represent an individual. It has infinite potential of development. It depends wholly on the users.
        </p>
